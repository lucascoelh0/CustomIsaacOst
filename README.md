# CustomIsaacOst
When finished, this app will allow the user to record the TV screen / monitor using an Android device camera and it will play the OST the user wants on the floor.

I recently got Isaac for PS5, and I really miss mods. The one I miss the most is the Antibirth OST, so I'm creating a workaround to allow the user to customize which OST will play on each floor (it will play on the phone/tablet, obviously).
